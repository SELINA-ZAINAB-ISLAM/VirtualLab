# VirtualLab

## Vision
![alt text](logo1.jpg)

The `VirtualLab` project aims to revolutionize the way scientific experiments are conducted and recorded by leveraging blockchain technology. Our decentralized platform provides a secure, transparent, and immutable way to submit, store, and retrieve virtual lab experiments. This ensures that all contributions are recognized, preserved, and accessible to everyone, thereby fostering innovation and collaboration in the scientific community.

## Flowchart

The flowchart below describes the basic operation of the `VirtualLab` contract:

1. **User Submits Experiment:**
   - Users interact with the smart contract through a user interface or directly via Remix IDE.
   - They provide the experiment's name and description.
   
2. **Contract Processes Submission:**
   - The smart contract assigns a unique ID to each experiment.
   - It stores the experiment details (name, description, owner address, and timestamp) on the blockchain.
   
3. **Event Emission:**
   - Once the experiment is recorded, the contract emits the `ExperimentSubmitted` event, which can be listened to by front-end applications or other services.

4. **Experiment Retrieval:**
   - Users can retrieve details of any experiment by providing its ID.
   - The contract returns the experimentâ€™s information (ID, name, description, owner, timestamp).

## Contract Address

**Network**: Educhain
**Contract Address**:0x6685a6d550F9943e06410278Dc99fdfBddeB5B11

## How to Use

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Open the contract in Remix IDE.
   - Compile the contract using Solidity version `^0.8.26`.
   - Deploy the contract using MetaMask or any other wallet connected to the specified Ethereum network.

2. **Submit an Experiment:**
   - Use the `submitExperiment` function with the required parameters (name, description).
   - After submitting, the experiment is stored on the blockchain, and an event is emitted.

3. **Retrieve Experiment Details:**
   - Use the `getExperiment` function to retrieve details of any experiment by its ID.

## Future Scope

The `VirtualLab` platform is just the beginning. Here are some future enhancements:

- **Decentralized Peer Review:**
  - Implement a system where experiments can be reviewed and validated by other users, ensuring the quality and reliability of the submitted data.
  
- **IPFS Integration:**
  - Store large experiment files or additional data on IPFS and link them within the blockchain for more comprehensive experiment documentation.

- **Reputation System:**
  - Introduce a reputation system for users based on their contributions and peer reviews.

- **Cross-Platform Integration:**
  - Develop integrations with existing virtual lab software, enabling seamless import/export of experiments.
